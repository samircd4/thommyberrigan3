# To-Do List for Commercial Real Estate Search App (Revised)

## 1. Project Setup

- [x] Project directory created and Python environment set up.
- [x] Required packages installed: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `requests`, `openpyxl`.

## 2. Data Preparation

- [x] `keywords.txt` file exists and is used for keyword management.

## 3. Backend Logic (`main.py`)

- [x] Implemented `get_list` to fetch listings from commercialrealestate.com.au.
- [x] Implemented `get_simplified_list` to return a simplified DataFrame for commercialrealestate.com.au.
- [x] Implemented `get_secondary_list` to fetch and simplify listings from realcommercial.com.au.
- [x] Implemented `get_both_list` to combine results from both sources and remove duplicates.
- [x] All DataFrames are saved to Excel files for reference.

## 4. Streamlit App (`app.py`)

- [x] Streamlit page set up with a title and wide layout.
- [x] Website selector for `commercialrealestate` and `realcommercial` (though only combined search is used).
- [x] Loads keywords from `keywords.txt`.
- [x] Multiselect widget for keywords.
- [x] Text input for adding new keywords (appends to `keywords.txt` if not present).
- [x] Number inputs for page number and page size.
- [x] Text input for sale method (comma-separated integers).
- [x] "Get Listings" button triggers search.
- [x] On button click:
  - [x] Calls `get_both_list` with selected filters.
  - [x] Shows a loading spinner while fetching.
  - [x] Displays the number of results found.
  - [x] Displays results in a table with clickable `seoUrl` links.
  - [x] Handles and displays errors.

## 5. Testing

- [ ] Test the app with various keyword and filter combinations.
- [ ] Test adding new keywords and ensure they persist in `keywords.txt`.
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid input, no results, API errors).

## 6. Documentation

- [ ] Update `README.md` with:
  - [ ] Project description and features.
  - [ ] Setup and run instructions.
  - [ ] Notes on data sources and requirements.

## 7. Bonus Features (Optional)

- [ ] Allow users to remove keywords from the list and update `keywords.txt`.
- [ ] Add basic styling/customization to improve the appâ€™s appearance.
- [ ] Allow user to select which website(s) to search (currently always searches both).

**Summary of Progress:**

- Core backend and frontend logic is implemented and functional.
- Keyword management (add) is implemented; removal is not.
- Combined search is always used, regardless of website selector.
- Testing and documentation are still needed.
- Some UI/UX improvements and feature refinements are possible.
